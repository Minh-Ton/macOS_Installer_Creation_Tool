An open-source AppleScriptObj-C application allows you to make a bootable macOS/OS X Installer... and more.

## Requirements
- Minimum requirement: OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and newer. (Requires OS X 10.7 or newer to download Installers)
- Supported Installers: OS X 10.9 Mavericks to macOS 10.15 Catalina.
- USB/Disk size: At least 10GB (10.15 Catalina); 8GB (10.9 to 10.14)

## Download
- Download latest version: [Download](https://github.com/Minh-Ton/openinstallcreator/releases) (beta 3)
- Download source code: [Download](https://github.com/Minh-Ton/openinstallcreator/archive/master.zip) (beta 3)

## Additional features
- The created Bootable Installer will have an Icon (shown in Boot Manager) base on the version of the Installer.

## AppleScriptObj-C Limitations
- When the app is running in the background, it won't show the GUI when clicked onto the Dock Icon. A workaround for this is to **_secondary click_** the openinstallcreator Dock Icon, then choose **_"Show All Window"_**
- While the app is doing some heavy tasks, such as `Create Bootable Installer` or `Download Apple Installer`, the *"spinning rainbow cursor"* will appeared when hovering the cursor on the application GUI. *(It's still doing it work though, just because there are so many tasks that's being added to the queue, making the queue banked up)*
