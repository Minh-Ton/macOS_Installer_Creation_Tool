## Limitations/Issues
<details>
  <summary>View Limitations</summary>

- When the app is running in the background, it won't show the GUI when clicked onto the Dock Icon. A workaround for this is to **_secondary click_** the openinstallcreator Dock Icon, then choose **_"Show All Window"_**.

- While the app is doing some heavy tasks, such as `Create Bootable Installer` or `Download Apple Installer`, the *"spinning rainbow cursor"* will appeared when hovering the cursor on the application GUI. *(It's still doing it work though, just because there are so many tasks that's being added to the queue, making the queue banked up)*.

 - As I'm using a vintage Mac, which only supports up to OS X 10.15 El Capitan so if there is any issue with 10.12 - 10.15 bootable installer creation, please let me know.
 
 - Due to the slow speed of downloading files from GitHub, I will push updates through Dropbox for a faster speed & reliability.
